## Description

The final version of my 30 ECTS Master's thesis I developed at the University of
Copenhagen under the primary supervision of Prof. Oswin Krause and with Prof. 
Christa Gall serving as co-supervisor.

The repository contains the implementation used to generate all results 
presented in the ``msc-thesis.pdf``. However, as the code was not part of the 
evaluation, it is undocumented and requires structural refactoring.
